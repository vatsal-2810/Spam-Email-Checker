# 📧 Spam Email Classifier  

A Machine Learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Naive Bayes classifier**.  
This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, model training, evaluation, and testing on custom inputs.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📂 Works with the **SMS Spam Collection dataset**  
- 🧹 Text preprocessing (stopwords removal, TF-IDF vectorization)  
- 🤖 Trained using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**  
- 📊 Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for evaluation  
- 📝 Test predictions on **custom email messages**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **pandas** – for data handling  
- **scikit-learn** – for ML model & evaluation  
- **NLP (TF-IDF)** – for text feature extraction
